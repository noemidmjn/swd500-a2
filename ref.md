# Project reflection

### After completing the project I think it would have been a better idea to choose a different subject for this assignment because I found the minimum 6 pages unnecessary for a portfolio website. 
### Overall I'm happy with the look of the home page but I find some of the other pages (such as "Blog") unnecessary.
### In the future I will definitely change these things up on the website before I actually start using it as a portfolio.
